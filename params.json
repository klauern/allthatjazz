{"name":"allthatjazz","body":"allthatjazz\r\n===========\r\n\r\nI'm a big fan of [Dropwizard](http://dropwizard.codahale.com), and I thought\r\nit would be a really fun Java project to get acquainted with RESTful APIs, clean\r\nJava libraries like [JDBI](http://www.jdbi.org), and just have some fun with\r\nJava. \r\n\r\nThis project is really the [dropwizard-example](https://github.com/codahale/dropwizard/tree/master/dropwizard-example), with some minor tweaks to handle running [BackboneJS](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) and\r\n[Twitter Bootstrap](https://twitter.github.com/bootstrap).\r\n\r\nI think this is fun stuff, and I was unaware of how cool and easy Backbone is\r\nto get running.\r\n\r\nCheck this project out if you'd like to toy with it.  I'd suggest starting by\r\nunderstanding what is required to run Dropwizard:\r\n\r\n  * Java 6+\r\n  * Maven\r\n\r\nAnd then you can bootstrap the app and just go with it:\r\n\r\n    mvn install\r\n    java -jar target/allthatjazz-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar setup hello-world.yml\r\n\r\n    # then, run it\r\n    \r\n    java -jar target/allthatjazz-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar server hello-world.yml\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is really just a facny front-end for a few really polished libraries.\r\nI'd really just look at the [Dropwizard documentation](http://dropwizard.codahale.com)\r\nto really learn what this is about.\r\n","tagline":"Dropwizard fun things (and some BackboneJS and Twitter Bootstrap)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
